 * <h1> Quadrilateral Hierarchy </h1>
 * This program is uses your points which is you gave before

 * it is working for Quadrilaterals which are Trapezoids Parallelograms Rectangles and Squares
 *
 * Also it is showing your points. Morover I can develop it,
 * I can add a visual table for each shape
 *
 * it is easy and understandable.
 *
 * <b> Note: </b>
 * this library has a hierarchy between Quadrilaterals and shape's common properties
